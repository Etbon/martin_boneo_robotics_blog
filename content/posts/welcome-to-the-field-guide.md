This blog is my robotics **field guide**: notes and tools from building robots — what worked, what broke, and what I learned.

## What you’ll find here
- Build logs (real progress, real mistakes)
- Short “toolbox” posts (reusable patterns + checklists)
- Clear explanations that don’t rely on memorizing

> [!TIP]
> If you learn differently (dyslexia / ADHD / or just “I need the why”), you’ll probably like how I write.

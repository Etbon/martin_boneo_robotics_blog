# Hi

I’m **Martin Etcheverry Boneo**, a robotics developer-in-training based in **Buenos Aires, Argentina**. I focus on building **robots that work in the real world**, not just polished simulation demos.

## What this blog is

This blog is my **field guide**: a practical record of projects, debugging sessions, experiments, and hard lessons learned. You’ll find **ROS 2 notes**, **launch-file pitfalls**, **TF mistakes**, system diagrams, and the reasoning behind design decisions — not just the final result.

If something breaks, I document it. If it works, I explain **why**.

## What I’m doing now

I’m currently working at the **UTN University Robotics Lab**, supporting research and hands-on robotics projects. I’m focused on learning how robotics systems are **designed, integrated, and scaled**, from simulation to deployment.

## Why robotics

I got into robotics because I believe **robots can solve real problems at scale**. I’m especially drawn to work where reliability matters: software, hardware, and integration that still holds up outside a perfect lab environment.

Before robotics, I interned at a small artisan sports car factory, helping build a **Ford Cobra Shelby replica**. That environment taught me respect for **precision, tolerances, quality control, and safety** — lessons I now apply to robotics.

## What you’ll find here

- ROS 2 systems and architecture notes  
- TF trees and frame-debug workflows  
- Launch files, parameters, namespaces, and common pitfalls  
- Simulation → real robot transfer lessons  
- Debugging write-ups (what failed, why, and the fix)  
- Curated resources (books, notes, diagrams, tools) that actually helped me move forward  

## Why I write

This blog has two goals:

1. **Teach through reality** — show what actually goes wrong and how to fix it.  
2. **Track my growth** — keep a clear, honest record of my progress as I level up.

If you’re learning robotics too, I hope this helps you move faster — and crash less.

## Hi 

I'm Martin Etcheverry Boneo. This page is my short bio and a quick snapshot of what I build, learn, and share here.

I am  , with a bias toward practical notes: what worked, what broke, and what I learned while building robots.

Outside of the lab, you'll usually find me [a short personal detail or interest].

## Who is this for 
Robotics developer-in-training building real systems with ROS 2.

This blog is my **field guide** and **toolbox**: practical notes from projects, debugging, and learning - focused on understanding, not memorization.

## What I’m focused on
- ROS 2 (C++): node architecture, services/actions, executors
- TF2: coordinate frames and transform debugging
- Nav2: configuration, behaviors, practical navigation
- URDF/Xacro + Gazebo/RViz: simulation and robot description
